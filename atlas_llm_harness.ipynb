Söz gelimi İlyada destanı 2000’li yıllarda Arkaik Çağ’dakinden çok farklı işlevler görür. Modern okurlar için bir başyapıt olarak Batı edebiyatında önemli bir yeri vardır. Ama Antik Yunan’da yaşayanlar, onun edebiyat olduğunu düşünemezlerdi çünkü kavramsal olarak henüz böyle bir sınıflama yoktu. Bu epik şiir, kurmaca olması yönüyle benzersiz bir yazın tarzı payesi almak şöyle dursun, toplumsal hayatla sıkı sıkıya bütünleşmişti; törenlerde okunuyor, öğretiliyor ve sık sık hukuksal anlaşmazlıkların karara bağlanmasında kullanılıyordu.\n","Question: Bu parçaya göre Antik Yunan’da İlyada destanının günümüzdeki gibi bir edebî yapıt olarak görülmemesinin nedeni aşağıdakilerden hangisidir?\n","Choices:\n","0.
